* Tue Apr 24 2018 Gandor build v0.0.39a
- Checks if Steam is running before launching a mod
- Closes  7dtd hung processes before launching a mod

* Mon Apr 23 2018 
 - Currently there is nothing inplace to
   autoupdate mods. The modders don't provide 
   a version file I can check to see if an 
   update is needed. My solution is to clone 
   the mod with git instead of just 
   downloading the mod with wget.

 - There are pluses and minuses to this approch.
(+) Mods are easily updated when git detects 
    an update to the mod's repo.
(-) We will have to maintain a cloned repo for each 
    mod that will use a little extra disk space.
(+) Fewer downloads. Many mods use the same mods
    in there configuration ie the Bigger Back Pack.
    So if we maintain a repo for these mods we won't
    have to download them all the time.
(+/-) Only mods that use git can be used.
    This is a + and - because not all modders use git
    so I have to maintain a separate repo for the mods
    that don't. I don't have time to keep my eye on
    every mod as it's updated. 

- Also this isn't something that can happen over night
  it's gonna take some time for me to get coded in.
  Luckly I already have some of the code in place.
  We already clone the mi4l data repo.
