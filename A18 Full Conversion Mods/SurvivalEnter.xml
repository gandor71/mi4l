For Alpha 18.4

Like from a17... Survival enter at your own risk 

The Title says it all If you like a challenge or play permdeath max difficutly I would advise you To do Just that ! 

New building and decoration blocks

It is highly Advisable to go into Dislong tower or pharmacy building at early game as you will be safe there
