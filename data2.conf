<Starvation for Alpha 16
The idea is to make a mod that tries to make things harder, more interesting, but also highly rewarding later in the game. Again, coding have been made by me, and most graphics where made by Pacco.>

<The Dying Lands>
<Alpha 16.4, 45-slot BBP Version Download (Not EAC friendly, also includes 45 slot minibike and dropped backpack increase)>
<System Settings Notes:
Recomended to have 16GB+ RAM. UMA's take a serious amount of RAM to run without issues.
If you encounter prolonged FPS issues or shimmering entities it is likely due to running out of RAM.
Reduce UMA textures to Medium unless you have over 16GB, and turn off SSAO.>
