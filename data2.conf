<Starvation for Alpha 16
The idea is to make a mod that tries to make things harder, more interesting, but also highly rewarding later in the game. Again, coding have been made by me, and most graphics where made by Pacco.>
<War of The Walkers V5.2 BBM>
<The Dying Lands>
<Alpha 16.4, 45-slot BBP Version Download (Not EAC friendly, also includes 45 slot minibike and dropped backpack increase)>
<The Expansion pack is meant to be viewed, as the name implies, as an expansion pack for the game. What this means is that it adds a bunch of new features to the game without dramatically changing the overall vanilla gameplay experience. Great if you're happy with 7DTD but just want to have more stuff to do. >
<The Overhaul pack adds the same items and content to the game as the expansion with the key difference being that unlike the expansion the overhaul, as the name implies overhauls some basic aspects of the game. Mainly the recipe system is considerably locked down compared to vanilla. The overhaul is intended for those who want a new experience from the game.>
