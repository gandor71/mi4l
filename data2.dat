It's was a 150 years since the Zombies first appeared. At 50 yrs in, People were finally starting to band together to counter the threat. 50yrs later humanity was finally starting to make a comeback..or so we thought!
It was about that time strange occurrences began happening, A new threat was emerging and coming out of the shadows! No one really knows why or how the Ghouls appeared! Ghouls.. heh Just another word for Monster but that's what we call them. So now, a 150 years since this madness began, humanity is once again struggling just to survive...>

The Expansion pack is meant to be viewed, as the name implies, as an expansion pack for the game. What this means is that it adds a bunch of new features to the game without dramatically changing the overall vanilla gameplay experience. Great if you're happy with 7DTD but just want to have more stuff to do.>

The Overhaul pack adds the same items and content to the game as the expansion with the key difference being that unlike the expansion the overhaul, as the name implies overhauls some basic aspects of the game. Mainly the recipe system is considerably locked down compared to vanilla. The overhaul is intended for those who want a new experience from the game.>

System Settings Notes:
Recomended to have 16GB+ RAM. UMA's take a serious amount of RAM to run without issues.
If you encounter prolonged FPS issues or shimmering entities it is likely due to running out of RAM.
Reduce UMA textures to Medium unless you have over 16GB, and turn off SSAO.>

The idea is to make a mod that tries to make things harder, more interesting, but also highly rewarding later in the game. Again, coding have been made by me, and most graphics where made by Pacco.>

Settler's Mod version 1.2

My aim is to create a progression type playstyle. Mostly aimed at MP and Multiplayer servers, fully xml, easy to use and host your own. 

I will add in new blocks / zombies / and items in every content patch, raise the max xp to match. We will have server events as well.  

My main goal is to allow you to build, expand and keep your base, while also having new things to look forward to during the longhaul between alpha's.   This is to be done with minimial to zero wipes.  I use smegz botman to manage the server.

The biggest Highlights:

-Ghouls attack Zeds and Animals, Zeds attack Ghouls and Animals, they all will attack you! (well some animals won't.. some!)
-Ghouls are the normal Spawns in the biomes.
-Zeds are the normal spawns in Pois.
-Hostile animals spawn in all Biomes.
-Timid Animals are mostly around Water and rare in other areas. Which means the Zeds and Ghouls are more in the water areas as well, along with the hostile Animals.
-Noise is the Killer. The sound system has been redone.
-Zeds can attract other zeds if allowed to continue to be noisy.
-The Player(s) actions have consequences, More noise, more zeds will likely spawn. You decided on how often by your actions. Use a gun expect zeds to come a calling eventually. Making a fort? Yeah that's noisy as well. Chopping down a tree? Busting a rock? Running? Going through a house and looting it? All alone in the dead of the night and the only sounds is you opening your storage containers? yep! more noise more of a chance to call zeds into your area. Allowing zeds or other entities to roam around your fort at night? yep they can make noise as well.
-All Canned Goods have a chance to lower your wellness.
-Towns/Cities have a chance to have multiple stores (both big and small) along with the strip stores.
-All Towns/Cities the streets are over grown.
-Main Roads are 2Track Roads (bonus: the center strip is clay)
-Yes! you'll still need to harvest the bodies to get items from them. This was done to get more entities on the screen without losing performance. So sorry if it's just not your type of thing.. Maybe A17 this will change (here's for hoping!)
-Zeds can die through dismemberment or with a lot of damage but I built in a safety catch as well, so no more needing extreme amounts of ammo to kill a zed (eg: 12 shots to the head type o thing).
-Plus a whole lot of other things..
